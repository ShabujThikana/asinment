            <p>A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and
                stroke,
                prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon
                blood
                sugar, which can help keep appetite in check.

                At least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially hundreds of
                different plant compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in
                order to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs. This not only ensures a greater diversity of
                beneficial plant chemicals but also creates eye-appealing meals.
